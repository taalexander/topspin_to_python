## Motivation

Doing complex analysis of TopSpin data can be a pain in TopSpin. Exporting and converting TopSpin data can also be a pain. TopSpinToPandas provides simple methods to convert raw TopSpin experiment folders/files to easy to use Pandas dataframes. Your analysis might still be a pain, but grabbing the data will be easy. 

## Installation

Currently requires a specfic fork of [Jcamp](https://github.com/whitewhim2718/jcamp) to read the TopSpin acqusition parameters. 
When fork is pulled into the main repository this README will be updated. 

Other required python dependencies are
``` numpy
